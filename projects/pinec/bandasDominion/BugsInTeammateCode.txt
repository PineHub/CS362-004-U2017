For adventurer, line 656, while drawntreasure < 1 instead of drawntreasure <2.  drawntreasure should be counted for <2 because adventurer should be drawing 2 treasures instead of 1.
This was caught via my random tester to see if postHandcount is 2 additional cards greater than postHandcount.  
Quite a few segmentation faults were caused by trying to increment a pointer like *z via *z++ instead of z= z+1.  I corrected that for all pointers. 
The bug for smithy was found for the loop on line 702 of dominion.c.  My teammate made the loop draw 4 cards instead of three.  
This was caught in the random tester which had a failed assertion for showing that the handcount was supposed to be 401, but was 402, and the deck was supposed to be 294, but was 293 instead. 
For councilRoom(), my unit test caught the bug of an additional drawCard() call on line 689 when it failed two tests of the hand count for player 2 and the discard+deck count of player 2.
